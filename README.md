Title: Machine Learning-Based Power Prediction for RTL-Level MIPS Processor Design.

This project focuses on predicting the power consumption of an RTL-level MIPS processor using machine learning techniques. RTL simulation data is collected and used as input features to train ML models that estimate power without running time-consuming gate-level simulations.
